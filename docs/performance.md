# psmux Performance: How Fast Is tmux for Windows?

psmux is a native terminal multiplexer for Windows, and this page is its performance record: what a psmux command costs, how long a new pane takes to show a PowerShell prompt, what the server uses in memory per pane, and where the time actually goes. Every number below was measured on a real machine with the commands shown, so you can reproduce them on yours.

## Key facts

- **A psmux CLI command round trip is about 15 to 25 ms**, including starting the `psmux.exe` client process, reading the registry files, connecting over loopback TCP, and printing the reply.
- **`new-session -d` takes about 50 ms** when the warm pool has a standby server ready, about 215 ms when it has to cold start one.
- **A new window shows a pwsh prompt in about 100 ms** when the server's spare shell is ready, 400 to 550 ms when the shell has to boot from scratch. Bare `pwsh -NoProfile -c exit` takes about 210 ms on the same machine, so psmux is not the bottleneck; the shell is.
- **The server process needs about 30 MB working set (15 MB private) for a session with 11 windows and 16 panes.** Each pane adds three lightweight threads and its scrollback buffer. The shells themselves (about 90 MB per pwsh) dominate memory, exactly as they would outside psmux.
- **Output rendering is event driven.** The server pushes a frame within a few milliseconds of ConPTY output; the client never has to poll for it.
- **Release builds use `opt-level = 3`, full LTO, one codegen unit, and stripped symbols** (`[profile.release]` in `Cargo.toml`).

For how these numbers come about, read [How psmux Multiplexes Natively on Windows](architecture.md). For the warm pool, read [Warm Sessions](warm-sessions.md).

## Reference machine

All measurements on this page were taken on 2026-08-29 with psmux 3.3.8 (commit cbb9c10) installed from `cargo install --path .`:

- Windows 11, build 26200
- PowerShell 7.6.5 as the default shell
- AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395, 96 GB RAM
- Timed from a PowerShell script with `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` around each `& psmux ...` call, so every figure includes the client process start

Your numbers will differ. Shell startup in particular depends on your profile, PSReadLine, oh-my-posh, and antivirus scanning of `pwsh.exe`.

## How long does a psmux command take?

Ten runs each against a session with one window (`psmux new-session -d -s perf -x 200 -y 50`):

| Command | min | median | max |
|---------|----:|-------:|----:|
| `display-message -p '#{session_name}'` | 16 ms | 18 ms | 26 ms |
| `list-panes` | 15 ms | 18 ms | 23 ms |
| `send-keys 'echo hi' Enter` | 15 ms | 20 ms | 26 ms |
| `capture-pane -p` | 18 ms | 24 ms | 38 ms |
| `split-window -h` (command returns; shell keeps booting) | 25 ms | 36 ms | 70 ms |
| `new-window` (command returns; shell keeps booting) | 31 ms | 58 ms | 74 ms |
| `kill-session` (waits for the process tree to exit) | 250 ms | 255 ms | 283 ms |

What that means for scripts: a loop that sends 100 `send-keys` commands finishes in about two seconds, and most of that is Windows creating 100 `psmux.exe` client processes, not the server. Chain commands with `\;` or use [control mode](control-mode.md) to send many commands over one connection when that matters.

## How long until a new pane is usable?

The command returning is not the same as the prompt being visible. This measures `new-window` until `capture-pane` shows a `PS C:\...>` prompt, polling every 5 ms:

| Run | new-window to visible pwsh prompt |
|-----|----------------------------------:|
| 1 | 562 ms (spare shell not ready, cold pwsh start) |
| 2 | 106 ms (spare shell claimed) |
| 3 | 432 ms |
| 4 | 94 ms |
| 5 | 403 ms |

The two clusters are the warm pane pool at work. Every server keeps one spare shell booted; the first `new-window` or `split-window` after a pause gets it in about 100 ms, and a burst of creates falls back to cold shell starts of 400 to 550 ms while the pool refills. Baseline for comparison, on the same machine:

| Command | min | median | max |
|---------|----:|-------:|----:|
| `pwsh -NoProfile -c exit` (no psmux involved) | 206 ms | 211 ms | 246 ms |

A cold pane costs the shell's own startup plus a couple of hundred milliseconds of PSReadLine and prompt rendering inside a fresh console. psmux's share of that is the ConPTY creation and the first frame, well under 50 ms.

## How long does session creation take?

| Scenario | min | median | max |
|----------|----:|-------:|----:|
| `new-session -d` with the warm pool enabled (default) | 45 ms | 50 ms | 51 ms |
| `new-session -d` with `PSMUX_NO_WARM=1` (cold server) | 203 ms | 216 ms | 243 ms |

The warm path is a rename of the standby `__warm__` server's registry files plus a claim message, which is why it is four times faster than spawning a server, binding the listener, loading the config, and booting the first shell. See [Warm Sessions](warm-sessions.md).

## What does the server use in memory?

After creating 11 windows and splitting the first window into 5 panes (16 panes in total, all pwsh):

| Process | Working set | Private bytes | Threads |
|---------|------------:|--------------:|--------:|
| `psmux.exe server -s perf` | 29.5 MB | 14.4 MB | 55 |
| each `pwsh.exe` pane (average) | about 94 MB | | |

Per pane the server adds three threads (ConPTY reader, VT parser, write queue) and the scrollback grid, which is `history-limit` rows times the pane width. With the default history the server's private memory grows by well under a megabyte per pane. The shells dominate: 16 panes of pwsh is about 1.5 GB of working set, and a tab of the same shell in any other terminal costs the same, because it is the shell's memory, not the terminal's. For a one pane session measured side by side with Windows Terminal, WezTerm and Alacritty on the same machine, see [Measured against the terminals on your machine](#measured-against-the-terminals-on-your-machine) below. Use `cmd`, `nu`, or `pwsh -NoProfile` for panes that only need to run one command (see [Multi-Shell](multi-shell.md)).

## The extreme scale harness

`tests/test_extreme_perf.ps1` is the repository's stress benchmark. It creates 100 sequential windows, 50 windows in a burst, splits one window until psmux refuses, builds a 20 windows by 5 splits mixed session, and then measures command round trips and `dump-state` serialisation with 100 panes alive. It writes a JSON summary with these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `baseline_noprofile_ms`, `baseline_profile_ms` | Raw `pwsh` startup with and without the profile, no psmux involved |
| `cold_start_ms` | `new-session -d` on a cold server until its first prompt is visible |
| `seq_prompt_p50`, `seq_prompt_p90`, `seq_prompt_p99` | Prompt ready latency percentiles across 100 sequential `new-window` calls |
| `seq_cmd_avg` | Average `new-window` command return time in that run |
| `burst_total_ms` | Wall time to fire 50 `new-window` commands and see 50 prompts |
| `max_splits` | Splits accepted in one window before "pane too small" (depends on the terminal size you give the session) |
| `mixed_total_ms`, `mixed_mem_mb` | Wall time and server memory for the 100 pane mixed session |
| `rtt_avg_ms`, `rtt_p90_ms` | Command round trip with 100 panes alive |
| `dumpstate_avg_ms` | Server time to serialise a full frame with 100 panes alive |
| `throughput_wps` | `new-window` commands per second over 200 calls |
| `final_mem_mb`, `mem_after_kill_mb` | Server memory at the end and after `kill-session` |

Run it yourself after a release build (it looks for `target\release\psmux.exe`):

```powershell
cargo build --release
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests\test_extreme_perf.ps1
# smaller and faster:
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests\test_extreme_perf.ps1 -SequentialWindows 20 -BurstWindows 10 -SkipPromptCheck
```

A recorded run kept in the repository root (`test_extreme_perf_results.txt`, from an earlier build on a smaller terminal) shows `seq_prompt_p50` of 158 ms, `seq_prompt_p90` of 418 ms, `seq_prompt_p99` of 433 ms, `dumpstate_avg_ms` of 1 ms, and a server `final_mem_mb` of 73 MB with 100 panes alive. The p50 to p90 gap is the same warm versus cold shell split visible in the table above.

## Measured against the terminals on your machine

`tests/test_perf_vs_terminals.ps1` is the benchmark that does not quote anybody's documentation. It launches every terminal emulator installed on the machine, runs the same shell inside each of them, and times psmux beside them. It is part of the test suite and `tests\run_all_tests.ps1` runs it as a performance suite, so `-SkipPerf` skips it.

```powershell
cargo build --release
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests\test_perf_vs_terminals.ps1
# smaller and faster
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests\test_perf_vs_terminals.ps1 -Quick
```

Hosts measured, in this order: bare `pwsh` in its own console, Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty, psmux attached in its own console, and psmux inside Windows Terminal. A terminal that is not installed prints SKIP and costs nothing. The exit code is the number of thresholds that failed, and every sample lands in `%USERPROFILE%\.psmux-test-data\metrics\perf_vs_terminals-<timestamp>.json` (schema `psmux.perf_vs_terminals.v2`), never in the repository. The JSON is rewritten after every section with `"complete": false` until the run ends, so a run that is interrupted still leaves the data it had and says which sections were asked for.

Point it at a specific binary with `-Binary <path>`; with no argument it uses `PSMUX_TEST_BIN`, then this checkout's `target\release\psmux.exe`, then the psmux on PATH. A renamed copy for an A/B must be called `pmux.exe`, which psmux recognises as one of its own server images. Every psmux cell runs in a per run `-L` socket namespace with its own `PSMUX_DATA_DIR`, so the suite never touches a session you are using.

### How to read the four numbers

**Launch to prompt.** Every cell runs the identical shell, `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -File marker.ps1`, and the marker script writes `[Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::GetTimestamp()` and its own PID into a file. QueryPerformanceCounter is system wide, so subtracting the timestamp the suite took immediately before `Start-Process` gives a sub millisecond, host neutral instant with no polling and no screen scraping. It is a shell readiness measure: it stops just before pwsh paints its first prompt, so it excludes each terminal's own first paint. The four GUI hosted cells go through one extra `cmd /c wrapper.cmd` hop, about 15 ms, so the wrapper can pin the child's environment; a `wt -w new` window is spawned by the Windows Terminal monarch process and would otherwise inherit that process's environment. The hop is in all four GUI cells, so GUI to GUI comparisons are exact.

Two psmux launch cells are reported. `psmux_attached` and `psmux_in_wt` cold start a server on every repetition, which is the first psmux window of the day. `psmux_attached_warm` and `psmux_in_wt_warm` run with a psmux server already alive, which is every launch after that, and are the cells the thresholds are judged on. Windows Terminal is usually already running, so its own figure is a window inside an existing process while WezTerm and Alacritty cold start a whole GUI process; `wt_was_running` in the JSON records which case was measured.

The cells are interleaved: repetition 0 of every host, then repetition 1 of every host, and so on. A machine can drift by a factor of two inside a minute, so five repetitions of Windows Terminal followed by five of psmux would be comparing two different machines. Round robin puts every cell in the same weather, which is what makes the psmux minus Windows Terminal delta worth quoting. The cold psmux cells run in a second socket namespace that is torn down after each repetition, which is what lets them be interleaved with the warm cells instead of run in separate blocks.

**Keystroke to screen.** Measured by `tests/keylat.cs` at the PTY level: a key record goes into the target console's input buffer and the same process watches that console's screen buffer for the echo, both timestamped from one QueryPerformanceCounter. Read the host rows and the psmux rows differently. For Windows Terminal, WezTerm and Alacritty the console being watched is the ConPTY pseudoconsole in front of pwsh, so those numbers are the ConPTY echo floor and contain none of the terminal's own GPU paint, another 8 to 16 ms of frame time in every one of them. For psmux the console being watched is the psmux client's own console, so the psmux number contains the entire pipeline: client input, the TCP hop, the pane write queue, ConPTY, the shell's echo, the VT parser, the pushed frame, and the client's render. psmux is measured far more strictly than the hosts beside it, which is why the psmux rows are judged against an absolute threshold and never against a ratio to a host row.

**Memory and CPU.** Collected in the keystroke cells, because that is the only section that holds one cell alive long enough to watch it. For each cell the suite identifies the processes that make the cell work and samples each one twice, at prompt ready and again after the keystroke run: the psmux server (found from its `<namespace>__<session>.pid` anchor file, so a warm standby or another psmux on the machine is never sampled by mistake), the psmux client, the pwsh being typed into, the terminal emulator above it, and the conhost or OpenConsole that owns the console.

Three numbers come out of that. `srv_ws`, `cli_ws` and `host_ws` are working set in MB at prompt ready, with private bytes in the JSON beside them. `cpu/100k` is CPU time consumed across the keystroke run, normalised to milliseconds of CPU per 100 keystrokes, so cells that ran different key counts stay comparable. `idle%` is CPU over a quiet window with nothing typed, as a percentage of ONE core, and it is the number worth watching: busy polling is invisible in every latency figure on this page and shows up only here. psmux really did once ship 1 ms sleeps that Windows rounded up to a 15.6 ms timer tick, so this column exists to catch the next one.

Idle is measured in two windows, because the psmux client polls adaptively (1 ms while typing, then 5 ms, then 50 ms) and so does ConPTY. The first window opens half a second after the last keystroke and measures the ramp down, not idle; the JSON keeps it as `idle_cpu_pct_of_core_settling` for comparison. The second opens several seconds later and is the steady state figure, the one in the `idle%` column and the one T7 is judged on.

Read `host_ws` with the `shared` column next to it. When the cell is a Windows Terminal tab, the hosting WT process also holds the user's own windows, so its working set is not that cell's cost and `shared` says `yes`. Its CPU delta is only as clean as the rest of that window is quiet: anything happening in another tab of the same Windows Terminal lands in the same counter. The psmux server and client columns have no such caveat, because those processes exist only for the cell being measured.

**Creation latency.** `new-session`, `new-window`, `split-window -v` and `split-window -h`, timed to a visible prompt over one persistent control connection where a `dump-state` round trip costs about 0.15 ms, so detection is effectively continuous instead of the 16 ms a fresh `capture-pane` client costs. These cells use the default pane shell so the warm pane pool is in play, which is exactly why they are bimodal: a claimed spare shell lands near 60 ms and a cold shell start near 500 ms. The suite prints BIMODAL whenever the maximum is more than three times the median rather than hiding the split in an average.

Each measured window is killed again as soon as its sample is taken. That is part of the measurement, not tidiness: every window left standing grows the frame the control connection has to read and rescan on every push, and a run that left twenty windows open reported 9 to 14 SECOND creations that were really the harness reading its own backlog.

### The thresholds

| Threshold | Limit | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| T0 every cell that was not skipped produced data | 0 missing | a pretty summary full of dashes is worse than a failing run, because it looks like a pass |
| T1 psmux attached launch to prompt | 1.5x bare pwsh | psmux owns its console the same way pwsh does; the extra work is the client, the server and the ConPTY |
| T2 psmux in Windows Terminal over plain Windows Terminal, warm | 300 ms | the steady state launch, the one a user meets all day |
| T2b the same, cold server | 700 ms | the first psmux window of the day also pays a server spawn |
| T3a psmux keystroke to screen, median | 10 ms | absolute, on psmux's own pipeline |
| T3b psmux keystroke to screen, p99 | 25 ms | absolute |
| T4a first session to a prompt | 1000 ms | a cold server plus a cold default shell |
| T4b `new-window` p90 | 300 ms | includes the 16 to 20 ms Windows needs to start the CLI client |
| T4c `split-window -v` and `-h` p90 | 300 ms | same |
| T5 leftover windows, tabs, shells or servers | 0 | a benchmark that litters the desktop is a benchmark nobody will run |
| T6a psmux server working set, one pane | 60 MB | measured at 14 to 25 MB, so the limit is about 2x the measurement: a leak alarm, not a tuning target |
| T6b psmux client working set | 60 MB | same reasoning; server plus client under 120 MB is the answer to "a multiplexer is heavy" |
| T7 psmux idle CPU, server plus client | 2 percent of one core | tmux on Unix is about 0 percent idle, and a Windows port that polls is the known failure mode. No latency test can see this |
| T8 psmux CPU per 100 keystrokes, server plus client | 500 ms | 5 ms of CPU per key against about 18 ms of wall time means the pipeline waits rather than spins |

A number that moves is a regression or a machine change, and the JSON keeps every sample so the two can be told apart by rerunning an old binary in the same time window.

### A recorded run, 2026-09-10

Three consecutive full runs at commit d69c310 on the reference machine, n=5 per launch cell, 40 keystrokes per latency cell, 5 creations per kind. The machine was NOT quiet: two other benchmark agents were running at the same time, which is why the middle of three runs is quoted and why the launch figures move by 100 ms between runs. Every cell produced data in all three runs and all three left nothing behind.

| Host | launch median | launch p90 | keystroke median | keystroke p99 |
|------|--------------:|-----------:|-----------------:|--------------:|
| bare `pwsh` in its own console | 352 ms | 409 ms | 1.49 ms | 3.29 ms |
| Windows Terminal | 444 ms | 786 ms | 0.77 ms | 1.88 ms |
| WezTerm | 557 ms | 1018 ms | 0.70 ms | 1.75 ms |
| Alacritty | 565 ms | 941 ms | 0.91 ms | 2.07 ms |
| psmux attached, server already running | 808 ms | 1160 ms | 18.94 ms | 27.44 ms |
| psmux in Windows Terminal, server already running | 908 ms | 1524 ms | 17.99 ms | 25.98 ms |
| psmux attached, cold server | 871 ms | 958 ms | | |
| psmux in Windows Terminal, cold server | 911 ms | 982 ms | | |

Read the keystroke column as the measurement note above says: the host rows are the ConPTY echo floor with no GPU paint, the psmux rows are the whole psmux pipeline ending in a painted client frame. psmux adds about 450 ms to a launch and is about 18 ms from key to screen; both miss their thresholds on this build, which is the point of having the thresholds.

Memory and CPU, same runs, one session with one window and one pane:

| Process | working set | private | CPU per 100 keystrokes | idle CPU, percent of one core |
|---------|------------:|--------:|-----------------------:|------------------------------:|
| psmux server | 15.3 MB | 3.7 MB | 547 to 1328 ms | 1.6 to 4.7 |
| psmux client | 8.7 MB | 2.1 MB | 3828 to 4258 ms | 3.7 to 6.3 |
| the pane's pwsh | 91 MB | 32 MB | 703 to 1250 ms | 0.0 |
| conhost hosting the psmux client | 15.8 MB | 2.4 MB | 5117 to 5508 ms | 1.6 to 3.7 |
| WezTerm | 115 MB | 370 MB | 313 to 547 ms | 0.0 |
| Alacritty | 108 MB | 252 MB | 117 to 156 ms | 0.0 |

Memory is the good news and it is not close: server plus client is 24 MB, against 108 MB for Alacritty and 115 MB for WezTerm hosting the same shell. T6 passes with a factor of two to spare.

CPU is the bad news, and it is the finding this suite was built to produce. The client spends about 40 ms of CPU per keystroke, and its conhost another 50, against roughly 18 ms of wall time per keystroke. More than one core's worth of work is being done to echo one character. Worse, with nothing typed at all the server and client together hold 7 to 10 percent of a core, and the conhost another 2 to 4, where WezTerm and Alacritty sit at a measured zero. That is a polling loop, it is invisible in every latency number on this page, and T7 exists to keep it visible.

Creation latency in the same runs: first session to a prompt 563 to 649 ms, `new-window` median 84 to 103 ms with p90 96 to 121 ms, `split-window -v` 85 to 104 ms, `split-window -h` 69 to 102 ms, and a burst of five windows all showing prompts in 525 to 616 ms. All comfortably inside T4.

### What it opens, it closes

T5 is a real threshold because this suite opens GUI windows. Everything it opens is closed by PID as soon as its measurement is captured, and the rule is attribution: a process is killed only when the run can show it started it, either because the suite spawned it, because it carries the run's scratch directory (which contains the suite's own PID) on its command line, or because it is a console host whose parent is one of the run's processes, or the GUI process the cell opened, and whose image is one the suite actually launches. That last clause matters more than it looks: PIDs are recycled within seconds on a busy machine, and without the image check an unrelated process that inherited a freed PID gets its console host blamed on the benchmark.

What T5 counts is what a user would have to close: a window, a tab, a shell, a psmux server. A conhost or OpenConsole that has outlived its client has no window of its own, so it is reaped and listed instead of failing the run. One that still holds a real client does fail it, and the failure line names the client.

The run's own process ancestry and every terminal that existed before it started are protected from every kill, and the suite refuses to start if that baseline looks wrong. It is worth knowing why: an earlier version built the baseline in a loop whose variable `$n` was the same variable as its own `[int]$N` parameter, so the baseline stayed empty, and the final audit then treated every terminal on the machine as one the benchmark had opened and killed it, including the window the benchmark was being run from.

## Where the time goes

- **Shell startup dominates.** pwsh takes 200 to 1000 ms to a prompt depending on the profile; psmux spends tens of milliseconds per pane. The warm pool exists to overlap the two.
- **Client process start is most of a CLI round trip.** The server answers a query in about a millisecond; the other 15 ms is Windows creating `psmux.exe`, loading it, and reading three small files. This is why control mode and `\;` chains are faster for automation.
- **Frame serialisation is about 1 ms.** `dump_layout_json_fast` (`src/layout.rs`) snapshots each pane's cells under its parser mutex for about a millisecond and serialises outside the lock, so rendering never blocks a pane's reader thread.
- **`kill-session` is slow on purpose.** It walks the process tree of every pane, verifies each pid's creation time so a recycled pid is never killed, and waits for the exits, which is where the 250 ms goes.

## How psmux keeps latency low

All of these are in the source today; the file is named so you can check.

| Technique | Effect | Where |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Server push rendering | A dirty state pushes a frame to attached clients within a few milliseconds instead of waiting for the next client poll | `src/server/mod.rs` |
| Adaptive client polling | 10 ms while typing, 16 ms idle with pushed frames, 1 ms while assembling a paste | `src/client.rs` |
| Reader and parser split | A 64 KB reader thread never takes the parser lock, and the parser coalesces bursts in 1 ms ticks | `src/pane.rs` |
| Per pane write queue | Keystrokes are queued and written by a dedicated thread, so a wedged child cannot stall the server loop | `src/pane.rs` (PR #543) |
| Lazy pane resize | Only the active window's panes are resized; background windows resize when shown, avoiding O(n) `ResizePseudoConsole` calls | `src/tree.rs` |
| Cached shell resolution | The default shell's path is resolved once per server in an `OnceLock` | `src/pane.rs` |
| Early port file write | The server binds its listener and writes `.port` before loading config or spawning shells, so an attaching client connects immediately | `src/server/mod.rs` |
| 10 ms attach polling | The client watches for the `.port` beacon in 10 ms ticks | `src/main.rs` |
| Warm servers and warm panes | Pre booted standby server and spare shell per server | [Warm Sessions](warm-sessions.md) |
| ConPTY passthrough | On Windows 11 22H2+ conhost forwards VT output as written instead of re rendering it | `crates/portable-pty-psmux` |
| Above normal priority | psmux's own server and client processes get `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` so a compile on every core cannot starve keystrokes (issue #608) | `src/platform.rs` |
| Release profile | `opt-level = 3`, `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = "symbols"` | `Cargo.toml` |

## Why native multiplexing suits scripted TUIs and terminal agents

Running a dozen terminal agents, a build watcher, a log tail, and a couple of editors from one script is the workload psmux is tuned for:

- **Dozens of panes are cheap on the psmux side.** The server cost is a few threads and a screen buffer per pane; the harness routinely runs 100 panes in one server. What you pay for is the programs in the panes, which you would pay for anyway.
- **Commands are local and cheap.** `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, `wait-for`, and `pipe-pane` are 15 to 25 ms loopback calls. There is no WSL boundary and no shell wrapper between your script and the pane.
- **Detached servers keep running.** A supervisor script can create sessions at boot, hand agents their panes, and attach from any terminal later. See [Windows Use Cases](use-cases.md).
- **Output arrives as it happens.** Push rendering means an attached client sees an agent's output within milliseconds, and `capture-pane` reads the same screen the parser holds.
- **The interactive path is protected.** Above normal priority for psmux's own processes keeps the client responsive while agents saturate the CPU.

The step by step guide is [Running Terminal Agents and TUIs in psmux](tutorials/terminal-agents-and-tuis.md), and the command reference is [Scripting and Automation](scripting.md).

Prompt ready latency for a new window:

```powershell
$sw = [Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()
psmux new-window -t perf -n probe
while ($sw.ElapsedMilliseconds -lt 20000) {
    $screen = (psmux capture-pane -p -t perf:probe) -join "`n"
    if ($screen -match 'PS [A-Z]:') { break }
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 5
}
"new-window to prompt: $($sw.ElapsedMilliseconds) ms"
```

Server memory:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='psmux.exe'" |
    Where-Object CommandLine -match 'server -s perf' |
    ForEach-Object { Get-Process -Id $_.ProcessId } |
    Select-Object Id, @{n='WS_MB';e={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet64/1MB,1)}},
                      @{n='Private_MB';e={[math]::Round($_.PrivateMemorySize64/1MB,1)}}, Threads
```

If a number looks wrong, the debug and crash logs described in [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md) show where the time went.

## FAQ

### Is psmux faster than tmux inside WSL?

For Windows shells, yes by construction: a pwsh pane in psmux is a direct ConPTY child, while reaching pwsh from tmux in WSL means `wsl.exe` to `pwsh.exe` interop on every pane and every script call. For Linux shells inside WSL the two are comparable; psmux runs `wsl.exe` in a pane and the Linux side is unchanged.

### Why does the first split after a pause feel instant and a burst of splits does not?

The spare shell. Each server keeps one shell booted for the next `split-window` or `new-window`; a burst uses it up and the rest cold start while the pool refills. Windows created in a loop still return in about 50 ms each; only the prompt takes longer to appear.

### Does psmux add input latency?

A keystroke goes client to server over loopback (sub millisecond), into the pane's write queue, into ConPTY, and the echo comes back through the reader, parser, and a pushed frame. End to end this is a few milliseconds, below the 16 ms frame time of the terminal you are typing into.

### How many panes can one server hold?

The harness runs 100 panes in one session as a routine test. The practical limit is memory for the shells and your patience with `list-panes`, not psmux.

### What should I change to make it faster?

1. Trim your PowerShell profile or use `pwsh -NoProfile` for utility panes; the shell is the slow part.
2. Leave the warm pool on (default).
3. Prefer `\;` chains or control mode over hundreds of separate `psmux` invocations in tight loops.
4. Keep `history-limit` reasonable if you run hundreds of panes; scrollback is the only per pane memory psmux itself allocates.
